#Nate Conley's CSS Framework
##A simple, unopinionated CSS Framework
My goal is to create a simple responsive framework, with minimal styling.

This framework will be based off of a simple 12-unit grid, and be mobile friendly.

You will need to use normalize.css:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/3.0.3/normalize.css">
```

And a meta viewport tag:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Examples and extensive documentation will be coming in the future! This is a work in progress.
